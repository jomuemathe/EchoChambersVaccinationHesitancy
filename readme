This repository contains (will contain :) ) the r-scripts accompanying the paper

Johannes Müller, Aurélien Tellier and Michael Kurschilgen
Echo chambers and opinion dynamics explain the occurrence of vaccination hesitancy
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03910

There are three scipts:
(a) Fit the reinforcement-distribution to a vector of vaccination coverage data
    fit.r
(b) Create a nearest-neighbour graph from GIS data
    graph.r
(c) Use the quasi-likelihood for the reinforcement-distribution on graphs
    to fit spatial vaccination coverage data.
The details (how data should be provided to the scripts) are contained
at the beginning of the respective scripts.
