Echo chambers and opinion dynamics explain the occurrence of vaccination hesitancy
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03910

There are two scipts:
(a) Fit the reinforcement-distribution to a vector of vaccination coverage data
    fit.r               (fitting the parameters, calling "estiReinforceV0.r", and performing test)
    estiReinforceV0.r   (optimization routine)
(c) Use the quasi-likelihood for the reinforcement-distribution on graphs
    to fit spatial vaccination coverage data.
    fitSpatial.r            (fitting the parameters)
    estiReinforceSpatV0.r   (optimization routine)
The details (how data should be provided to the scripts) are contained
at the beginning of the respective scripts.
